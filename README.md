# Hypertension Detection
Analysis of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals for the Prediction of Hypertension using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction
Hypertension is the second leading cause of death in India following tobacco and a major risk factor for heart disease and strokes. Several studies find neither doctors nor patients are doing enough to fight it. Thus, this project aims at harnessing the power of Convolutional Neural Network to ease the process of diagnosing Hypertension even for common folks like us.
